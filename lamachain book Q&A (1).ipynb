Is it myself \\nthat I am projecting?” And then, “ Am I productizing it? Am I \\nscaling it? Am I scaling with labor or with capital or with code \\nor with media?” So it’s a very handy, simple mnemonic.\\xa0[78]\\nThis is hard. This is why I say it takes decades—I’m not saying \\nit takes decades to execute, but the better part of a decade may \\nbe figuring out what you can uniquely provide.\\xa0[10]\\nWhat’s the difference between wealth and money?\\nMoney is how we transfer wealth. Money is social credits. It \\nis the ability to have credits and debits of other people’ s time.\\nIf I do my job right, if I create value for society, society says, “Oh, \\nthank you. We owe you something in the future for the work \\nyou did in the past. Here’ s a little IOU. Let’ s call that money.”\\xa0[78]\\nWealth is the thing you want. Wealth is assets that earn while \\nyou sleep. Wealth is the factory, the robots, cranking out things. \\nWealth is the computer program that’ s running at night, serv -\\ning other customers. Wealth is even money in the bank that is \\nbeing reinvested into other assets, and into other businesses.\\nEven a house can be a form of wealth, because you can rent it \\nout, although that’ s probably a lower productivity use of land \\nthan some commercial enterprise.\\nSo, my definition of wealth is much more businesses and assets \\nthat can earn while you sleep.\\xa0[78]', metadata={}),\n",
